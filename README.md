# Vehicle Profile

Vehicle-profile component is responsible to create and maintain profile of each vehicle that has been on-boarded to platform. Vehicle profile holds details specific to a vehicle and also details of device that's plugged into vehicle along with capabilities and services that's been provisioned for combination of vehicle and device. Vehicle profile are created and maintained in Mongo DB with the attributes like vehicleId, vin, ecus, authorizedUsers, vehicleArchType  etc.

## Getting Started

Vehicle profile consists of below two components which are used for profile creation and management.
* vehicle-profile-api  
* vehicle-profile-sp

To build the project in the local working directory after the project has been cloned/forked, run:

```mvn clean install```

from the command line interface.

### Prerequisites

1. The list of tools required to build and run the project:
    JDK 11
    Apache Maven 3.8

Download and Install Apache Maven 3.8 locally and follow the below steps for IntelliJ IDE:
* Go to the right corner of the IDE and get inside the Maven option.
* Select the Maven Settings option and set the Maven Home Path to the path of the Apache Maven 3.8 installed locally.
* Click Apply and then OK.

2. Mongo DB need to installed and ignite database/schema should be created with the required tables.

* Link of the database and table scripts to be installed : 

```
mqtt_user_password : it is the password to connect with MQTT.

### Installation

[How to set up Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

[Install Java](https://www.tutorials24x7.com/java/how-to-install-openjdk-17-on-windows)


### Coding style check configuration

[checkstyle.xml](./checkstyle.xml) is the coding standard to follow while writing new/updating existing code.

Checkstyle plugin [maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) is integrated in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) which runs in the `validate` phase and `check` goal of the maven lifecycle and fails the build if there are any checkstyle errors in the project.

There are a few coding guidelines to be followed manually before requesting for a pull request, the same can be found here:

[Manual coding guidelines](Link to page with coding guidelines)


### Running the tests

To run the tests for this system run the below maven command.

```mvn test```

Or run a specific test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheFirstUnitTest"```

To run a method from within a test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheSecondUnitTest#whenTestCase2_thenPrintTest2_1"```

### Deployment

We can deploy this component as a Kubernetes pod by installing Vehicle Profile charts.

Link:
[Charts](../../../csp-opensource-charts/tree/main/vehicle-profile)

Detailed information about the request and response generated by the [Vehicle Profile restful services](Refer to API specifics of vehicle-profile).

## Architecture

## Usage

Vehicle Profile component will be responsible for the below features,

1. VIN Event Processing : The HCP component / dongle will generate VIN events which will provide details about the Device Id and connected Vehicle. This will be processed by the Ignite Platform Vehicle Profile SP component.

2. Vehicle Profile APIs : Set of RESTFul API are exposed which can be used to query the Vehicle Profile associated with different vehicles present in the system. It also provides certain APIs which can be used to modify the vehicle attributes as part of VIN processing.

3. VIN Decoding :  The Vehicle Profile SP will decode the VIN (via NHTSA decoder, code-value decoder or vehicle-specification decoder) to obtain MMY details about the vehicle. These are used for user experience and also to provide config data back to the device for data calculation.

4. Vehicle Profile switching : The Vehicle Profile SP also handles switching of vehicle profiles between devices / vehicles.

5. Push Notification : The Vehicle Profile SP will send push notification (MMY notifications) to the Client Apps if make, model, year could not be derived via VIN Decoding. The mobile application will use this to show input screens for user to input MMY data. This will in turn call the RESTFul api to update the attributes associated with the connected vehicle.

6. Configuration for device/dongle : Vehicle Profile SP Component will send vehicle config data to the device / dongle to capture vehicle related data.
